Here's a concise introduction for a *Smart Diaper Moisture Detection System using Arduino UNO*:

---

The Smart Diaper Moisture Detection System is designed to improve care for infants and elderly individuals by providing timely alerts when a diaper needs changing. Utilizing the Arduino UNO as the main controller, this system integrates moisture sensors to detect wetness levels in diapers. When moisture reaches a threshold, the sensor triggers a signal to notify caregivers through an LED, buzzer, or even a wireless communication module. This reduces discomfort, minimizes skin irritation, and promotes better hygiene by allowing for immediate action. Easy to implement and cost-effective, the Smart Diaper system is an ideal solution for hospitals, nursing homes, and personal care settings, enhancing both comfort and health monitoring.
